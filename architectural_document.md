**The Big Idea:** What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product ? What is a stretch goal?

We plan to take an image, pixelate it, and then match the colors of the pixels to colors of Legos. We will explore and combine image processing, data mining, UI, and optimization. The program will generate a list of the Lego bricks needed and a representation of the given image in Lego colors. Our minimum viable product will pixelate the image and tell you what Legos to buy. Our stretch goals are to allow for different color filters on the image, to optimize for cost and size of Lego bricks and to make a nice user interface. 

**Learning Goals:** What are your individual learning goals for this project?

**Anil** - processing image data and colors for lego translation.
**Ana** - To learn how to match the colors in the image to Lego colors, and to get better at scraping data from websites. 
**Kerry** - Learn how to pixelate, search websites for specific information, and be more comfortable with designing UI
**Onur** - Getting better at using different libraries/packages and GUI, along with getting more comfortable with OOP.
**Annie** - To get better at collaborative programing, learn more about creating nice user interfaces, and become comfortable with integrating the different parts of a group program

**Implementation Plan:** This will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don’t have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.
	
We will be using Pillow as an image processing library and possibly pygame for user interface. For the data mining and user input portions of the project, we will use the skills we have already developed to get information from the Lego project and get the image from the user. There is a list of libraries we will explore for creating user interface. We are planning on working together during the initial phases of the project and then splitting up into topics that interest us as we move forward. 

**Project schedule:** You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

**Week 1** - Planning and coordinating structure
**Week 2** - Break up into sections and start working on our program
**Week 3** - Work on sections
**Week 4** - Finish up code for sections
**Week 5** - Integrate parts
**Week 6** - Polish and work on stretch goals
**Tentative Meeting Times:** Wednesday - 1:00 PM-3:00 PM; Saturday - 10:00AM-12:00PM

**Collaboration plan:** How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
	
We have split our project into a series of high-level sections that can be split between people. We will start working as a team and then dividing and organizing roles/tasks as we better understand how the project will be structured.

Pixelation, choosing sizes based on cost, user input, output User Interface, and color assignment are sections that we will split among ourselves. 

Some areas we are considering using to divide up the project are as follows:
Pixelation
Choosing sizes based on cost
User input
Output User Interface
Color assignment

**Risks:** What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

Not prioritizing this project over other projects may be risky, as well as not dividing up the work evenly and not sharing expectations for the progress and quality of the project with one another. Different member’s pacing conflicting with other group member’s ability to complete their sections could also pose a problem.

**Additional Course Content:** What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

Going over more examples of user interfacing would be useful because currently, we only have experience using pygame to create the UI.  It would also be helpful to go over data processing and Python and how to parse HTML sites to get information.
